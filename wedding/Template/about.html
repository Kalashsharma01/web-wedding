      <h1>A decade old credible brand with presence in Mumbai and Delhi NCR!</h1>
  
      <p>Established in 2012, the journey of CandidShutters began as a young soul’s yearning to share and showcase the emotional happy stories of love, camaraderie, and celebration.
          <br>
          CandidShutters was started by Pranjal Kumar, an engineering graduate from BITS Pilani Goa and an MBA from NMIMS, Mumbai, whose love for cinema and passion for technology made him bid goodbye to plush jobs in the corporate and chart out his own path leading to creative satisfaction and realisation.
          <br>
          In his soul satiating journey, he was joined in 2019 by Neha Talwar, an Economics graduate from Delhi University and an MBA from NMIMS, Mumbai, who helped streamline the creative growth process at CandidShutters and helped it in diversifying further into related industries.
          <br>
          What fascinates them about weddings is the tremendous power they wield into pulling an entire clan together and offer a perfect platform to experience myriad of emotions under one roof. There is nothing more creatively stimulating and satisfying than that.
          <br>
          Together they work as a team with their passionate crew of photographers, cinematographers, editors, and designers on a relentless mission of turning their clients’ vision into a living reality.</p>
